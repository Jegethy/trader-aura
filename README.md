# Trader Protection Aura Mod

Trader Protection Aura is a very simple, niche modlet that is designed for use with custom trader POIs, such as those found in Compopack, but can also be used without them.

The modlet adds a buff to traders which protects any players within range, making them invulnerable to damage and immune to ailments and debuffs.
The protective aura persists for 3 seconds after leaving the trader's vicinty, providing a small grace period from damage.

## Mod Versions

### Trader Protection Aura Anti-Cheese (Recommended for servers)
